# Hi Deeksha, Hi Ashvanth

# On this auspicious day.....

# Let the sun shine bright 
# to make our lives bright
# 
# We are the sun with all different kinds of light
# Guiding light of ours, Let it shine for endless hours

# See the light in each other
# Be the light for each other

# Keep shining

# It is impossible to imagine festivals without a platter full of laddoos, barfis, hawla and what not! 

# mmm….mouth watering….Let us celebrate the festival with a diversity of sweets!
# Let us have a Great start for the year with Makar sankranti and Pongal

# Pongalo Pongal...Pongalo pongal
